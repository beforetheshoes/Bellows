## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **SwiftUI** for the user interface
- **SwiftData** for persistence and data modeling
- **Swift Testing** framework for comprehensive test coverage

### Key Components

#### Data Models
- `DayLog`: Represents a single day's exercise activities
- `ExerciseItem`: Individual exercise entry with amount, ratings, and timestamp
- `ExerciseType`: Types of exercises (Walk, Run, Yoga, etc.)
- `UnitType`: Measurement units (Minutes, Reps, Miles, etc.)

#### Views
- `HomeView`: Main dashboard showing today's exercises and streak
- `DayDetailView`: Detailed view of a specific day's activities
- `HistoryView`: Calendar-style navigation of past exercise logs
- `AppRootView`: Tab-based navigation container

#### Services
- `Analytics`: Streak calculation and statistics
- `SeedService`: Default data initialization
- `DedupService`: Data deduplication utilities

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Install `xcbeautify` for better formatted test output:
  ```bash
  brew install xcbeautify
  ```

### Running Tests
