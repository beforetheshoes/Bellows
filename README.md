- `ExerciseType`: Types of exercises (Walk, Run, Yoga, etc.)
- `UnitType`: Measurement units (Minutes, Reps, Miles, etc.)

#### Views
- `HomeView`: Main dashboard showing today's exercises and streak
- `DayDetailView`: Detailed view of a specific day's activities
- `HistoryView`: Calendar-style navigation of past exercise logs
- `AppRootView`: Tab-based navigation container

#### Services
- `Analytics`: Streak calculation and statistics
- `SeedService`: Default data initialization
- `DedupService`: Data deduplication utilities
